# Chollerton Tearooms
this is a sample website for an imaginary facility called Chollerton Tearooms as a university project which I had to do
goals in this project is to :
- do not use any framework
- have a responsive design
- get "no error" from <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="a_blank">https://validator.w3.org</a>
nothing special, just wanted to have the code here too, you can have view on it here :
